# Machine Learning for Scientists

These are the materials for a roughly one day course intended to
provide an introduction to some of the key methods and concepts in
machine learning, aimed at a scientific audience.

The presentation can be viewed at http://ljdursi.github.io/ML-for-scientists . 

The intent is that attendees with some experience in scientific
data analysis (curve fitting, etc) and some familiarity with python
or R would, after working through this material:

* Have some basic familiarity with key terms,
* Have used a few standard fundamental methods, and have a grounding in the underlying theory,
* Understand some basic concepts with broad applicability.

It covers, in python (sklearn, but also some other packages), most or all of the following methods:

* Regression:
   - OLS
   - LOESS
   - Lasso
* Classification
   - Logistic Regression
   - kNN
   - Naive Bayes
* Density estimation
   - Kernel Methods
* Clustering
   - k-means,
   - hierarchical clustering

... but more importantly, it covers these concepts:

* Bias-Variance Tradeoff
* Resampling methods
   * Bootstrapping
   * Cross-Validation
   * Permutation tests
* Model Selection
* Variable Selection
* Multiple Hypothesis Testing
